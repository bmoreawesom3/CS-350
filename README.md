# CS-350

In this project we were responsible for creating a prototype using the TMP 006 temperature sensor to read room temperatures via the I2C protocol using an LED to indicate the output to the thermostat whether the LED was on meant the heat was on as well. The two buttons on the side of the board were meant to increase or decrease using the gpio interrupt interface and the UART protocols to simulate the data being sent to a server.

What did you do particularly well?
  -During this project I was able to analyze the information and data given which helped me prepare for the effort of setting up the program. This helped me understand the     project at a better level so it allowed me to reference the information while I was writing the code.
  
Where could you improve?
  -I could have improved in understanding the protocols better. The UART and the I2C protocols were areas that I feel I needed to read more about to better understand what they are fully capable of.
  
What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
-We're adding the ability to send the information to the UART servers while communicating with the thermostat. This could add features of having a smart home setup to control the thermostat via a home assistant.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
-The skills learned from this project will help me right future code for projects in dealing with embedded systems. The I2C and the UART protocols will help me develop boards that have capabilities with Wi-Fi connections.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
-The code and variables used in this project were thought of down to a basic system. This allows for this project to be continued by another user while easily referencing the current variables. The UART and I2C protocols are highly documented online and the board used in this project is very capable of expanding the project.
